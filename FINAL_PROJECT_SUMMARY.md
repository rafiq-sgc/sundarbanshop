## Ekomart – Final Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the key features implemented, major code changes, fixes, and deployment setup completed for the Ekomart application.

### Core Features Delivered
- **Guest Orders**: Unauthenticated users can place orders.
- **Order Model Enhancements**: Optional `user`, added `guestEmail`, optional `email` inside `shippingAddress`/`billingAddress`, and optional `state`/`zipCode`.
- **Checkout Flow**: Unified checkout that supports both authenticated and guest users; guest cart cleared from `localStorage` on success.
- **Order Emails**:
  - Order confirmation email with PDF invoice on creation.
  - Order status update emails (e.g., shipped/cancelled/delivered).
- **Public Order Lookup**: Public endpoint for fetching an order to support guest order confirmation page.
- **Admin UX**: Admin order details now gracefully display guest customer info.

### Key Application Changes
- `src/models/Order.ts`
  - Made `user?: string`.
  - Added `guestEmail?: string`.
  - Added optional `email` in addresses; `state`/`zipCode` optional with schema `required: false`.

- `src/app/api/orders/route.ts`
  - Removed hard session requirement to allow guest orders.
  - Builds order items from DB cart (auth) or request body (guest).
  - Computes `subtotal`, `tax`, `shipping`, `total`.
  - Cleans optional address fields (empty → undefined).
  - Sends confirmation email with PDF via `order-email.service`.
  - Clears DB cart for authenticated users; returns `clearCart` flag for guests.

- `src/app/checkout/page.tsx`
  - Guest-friendly checkout: optional `zipCode`, “Full Address” label, optional `email` in shipping address.
  - Uses `frontendCheckoutService.createOrder` (calls public `/api/orders`).
  - Clears guest cart from `localStorage` after success.

- `src/services/frontend/checkout.service.ts`
  - Calls `${API_BASE_URL}/orders` to avoid double `/api` path.
  - Handles both auth and guest inputs.

- `src/services/order/order-email.service.ts`
  - Centralized email sender using Nodemailer and env-configured SMTP.
  - `sendOrderConfirmationWithInvoice` generates invoice PDF from template helpers and sends as attachment.
  - `sendOrderStatusUpdate` sends transactional updates with templates.

- `src/app/api/email/order-confirmation/route.ts`
  - API endpoint to generate a PDF invoice and send order confirmation email (used earlier); now superseded by direct service usage.

- `src/lib/email-helpers.ts` and `src/lib/pdf-utils.ts`
  - Generates order confirmation HTML and a simple invoice PDF buffer when needed.

- `src/app/api/orders/[id]/route.ts`
  - Public endpoint to fetch a single order for guest order confirmation page.
  - Adds `isGuestOrder` and `customerInfo` in response.

- `src/app/order-confirmation/page.tsx`
  - No auth redirect for guests; fetches via public API.
  - Conditional CTAs and guest-order guidance.

- `src/app/admin/orders/[id]/page.tsx`
  - Uses `customerInfo` for both registered and guest orders.
  - Avoids runtime errors when `user` is absent.

### Email Delivery Consolidation
- Order creation previously used a simple API + hardcoded SMTP; now unified to use `src/services/order/order-email.service.ts` with env-driven SMTP.
- Updated environment variable schema:
  - `EMAIL_SERVICE`, `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_PORT`, `EMAIL_USER`, `EMAIL_PASSWORD`, `EMAIL_FROM`, `EMAIL_FROM_NAME`.
  - Legacy `SMTP_*` kept for compatibility but not required.

### Build & Type Safety Fixes
- Resolved TypeScript errors via explicit types/casts for Mongoose docs and corrected Zod error handling (`error.issues`).
- Fixed property name mismatches and reduce typing issues.

### Deployment & Infrastructure
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Using cloud MongoDB; removed local MongoDB from production compose.
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` (updated)
  - Services: `app`, `redis`, `nginx`.
  - Uses `MONGODB_URI` for Atlas.
  - Exposes email env vars; healthchecks included.
- `nginx.conf`
  - Reverse proxy, gzip, caching headers, security headers, `/health` endpoint.
- `deploy.sh`
  - Atlas-ready deployment with health check validation.
- `env.example`
  - Atlas connection string + expanded email config.
- `src/app/api/health/route.ts`
  - Health check endpoint (DB connection + metadata).

### Notable Bug Fixes
- 401 checkout bug for guests by moving to public `/api/orders` and new frontend service.
- 404 from double `/api` path by correcting `API_BASE_URL` usage.
- Mongoose validation on optional fields by cleaning empty strings and marking optional in schemas.
- Guest redirection loops on order confirmation eliminated by using public order details.
- Admin order details null-user runtime error fixed via `customerInfo` mapping.
- Email sending for order creation now uses the same robust service and environment configuration as status updates.

### Remaining Considerations
- During `next export`, several routes reported dynamic usage warnings for admin APIs; these are expected for serverful runtime and do not block a Docker/Node deployment.
- Ensure production `.env` provides valid SMTP credentials (e.g., Gmail App Password) and `NEXTAUTH_URL` is set to your domain.

### Quick Deployment Steps (Production)
1. Set `.env` with: `MONGODB_URI`, SMTP email vars, `NEXTAUTH_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `JWT_SECRET`.
2. Build and run:
   - `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build`
3. Validate:
   - `curl http://your-domain/health`
   - Place a guest order and verify confirmation email.

Ekomart is now guest-order capable, email-enabled, Atlas-ready, and configured for production deployment.
